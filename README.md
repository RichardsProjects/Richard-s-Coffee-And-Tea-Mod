Coffee and Tea Mod (Minecraft Mod)
==============

This is the official repository for the Coffee and Tea Minecraft Mod. This mod is written using the forge mod API and currently works with versions 1.7.2 & 1.7.10 of Minecraft. All code is publicly available for reference and educational purposes. However, neither the code nor fully the compiled mod should ever be publicly redistributed and doing so is a violation of the license. This repository is the development version of the mod and may be more advanced than currently available versions. This means that their may still be many bugs in the code if you build the mod from the source code here.
